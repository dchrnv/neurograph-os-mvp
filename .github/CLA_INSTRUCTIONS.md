# How to Sign the NeuroGraph CLA

**Welcome, Contributor!** 🎉

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NeuroGraph. Before we can accept your contribution, we need you to agree to our **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)**.

This document explains **why** we need a CLA and **how** to sign it.

---

## Why Do We Need a CLA?

NeuroGraph uses a **dual licensing model**:

- **Open Source** (Free): AGPLv3 for code, CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 for data/models
- **Commercial** (Paid): Proprietary licenses for enterprises and commercial users

The CLA allows us to:

1. **Distribute your contribution** under the open-source license (AGPL/CC) for the community
2. **Sell commercial licenses** to fund ongoing development and support
3. **Maintain project sustainability** without relying solely on donations

**Important:** You keep the copyright to your contributions! The CLA only grants **additional rights** to the project owner to enable dual licensing.

---

## What Does the CLA Say?

**TL;DR:**

- ✅ You retain copyright to your contributions
- ✅ You grant us permission to use your contribution under AGPL/CC (open source)
- ✅ You grant us permission to use your contribution in commercial licenses (proprietary)
- ✅ You confirm you have the legal right to contribute
- ✅ You'll be credited in CONTRIBUTORS.md

**Full CLA:** [docs/legal/CLA.md](../docs/legal/CLA.md)

**Explanation of dual licensing:** [docs/legal/DUAL_LICENSING.md](../docs/legal/DUAL_LICENSING.md)

## FAQ

### Q: Why do I need to sign a CLA?

**A:** Without a CLA, we cannot legally sell commercial licenses that include your contribution. The CLA ensures that:
- You retain copyright
- The community gets open-source access (AGPL/CC)
- The project can fund ongoing development through commercial licenses

### Q: What if I don't want to sign the CLA?

**A:** Unfortunately, we cannot accept contributions without CLA acceptance. This is necessary to maintain the dual licensing model that funds the project.

**Alternative:** You can fork the project and maintain your own version under AGPL/CC licenses, but you won't have the rights to sell commercial licenses.

### Q: Can I revoke my CLA acceptance later?

**A:** No. The CLA is **irrevocable** to ensure long-term project stability. However, this only affects your specific contributions—you remain free to use your code elsewhere.

### Q: What if my employer owns my work?

**A:** If you're contributing during work hours or using company resources, you **must** obtain employer approval before signing the CLA. Ask your legal/HR department.

**Option:** Have your employer sign the Corporate CLA (see Option C above).

### Q: Will I get credit for my contributions?

**A:** Yes! You'll be credited in:
- GitHub Contributors list (automatic)
- **CONTRIBUTORS.md** (manual, added by maintainers)
- Release notes (for significant contributions)

### Q: What happens to my contributions if I sign the CLA?

**Dual licensing:**
1. **Open Source Path:** Your contribution is available under AGPL/CC for everyone
2. **Commercial Path:** The project owner can include your contribution in proprietary licenses sold to enterprises

Both paths exist **simultaneously**—open source remains free forever.

### Q: Can the project owner "steal" my contributions?

**A:** No! You retain copyright. The CLA only grants **additional permissions** for dual licensing. You can still:
- Use your contribution in other projects
- License it however you want elsewhere
- Get credit and recognition

### Q: What if I contributed before the CLA existed?

**A:** We'll retroactively request CLA acceptance for past contributions. If you decline, we'll either:
1. Remove your contributions, or
2. Negotiate alternative arrangements

### Q: Does this apply to bug reports and documentation?

**A:** CLA applies to:
- ✅ Code contributions (Rust, Python, JS, etc.)
- ✅ Documentation (docs, README, tutorials)
- ✅ Data assets (CDNA, datasets, models, weights)
- ✅ Configuration files (Docker, CI/CD, etc.)
- ❌ Bug reports (just reporting, not contributing code)
- ❌ Feature requests (ideas are not copyrightable)

### Q: What about machine learning models and datasets?

**A:** If you contribute:
- **Model weights** (pre-trained networks)
- **Training datasets** (data for training models)
- **Fine-tuned models** (adapted versions of models)

The CLA covers these under the "Machine Learning Assets" section, allowing the project to:
- Use your models/data in the open-source version (CC BY-NC-SA)
- Use your models/data in commercial products (proprietary license)

### Q: I have more questions. Who do I contact?

**A:** Email the project owner:

**Chernov Denys**
- Email: dreeftwood@gmail.com
- GitHub: [@dchrnv](https://github.com/dchrnv)
